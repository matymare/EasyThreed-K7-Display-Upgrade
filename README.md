## Installation Guide
Follow these steps to upgrade your EasyThreed K7 with the new display:

> [!TIP]
> Before starting the upgrade, print all necessary 3D parts (such as the display box and holder) while your printer is still fully assembled. Upgrading the printer may involve partial disassembly, which could make it difficult or impossible to print parts afterward. You can find the required 3D models on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6873216) Preparing these components beforehand will save time and help you avoid unnecessary complications during the upgrade process.

1. **Download the Firmware:**
	- Choose the appropriate firmware file (`mksLite.bin`) from this repository based on your preferred language (e.g., English or Czech).
	- Format a microSD card as FAT32 and copy the `mksLite.bin` file onto it. Ensure no other files are on the card to prevent potential conflicts during the update.
	- Insert the microSD card into the printer **while it is powered off**, then turn on the printer. Wait for less than 30 seconds while the firmware installs automatically.
	- After the update is complete, the firmware file on the SD card will be renamed to `mksLite.cur`, indicating a successful installation.

2. **Remove the Bottom Cover and Access the EXP1 Connector:**
	- Start by unscrewing the four screws that secure the bottom cover of the printer.
	- Once the cover is removed, locate the **14-pin connector** labeled **EXP1**. This is where the LCD display will be connected to the mainboard.

3. **Connect the LCD Display Using DuPont Wires**
	- Carefully remove the existing connector from the EXP1 port on the mainboard.
